    "There are many situations where you might like to get data from a database into a `pandas` dataframe. The simplest way to is to initialize a dataframe via the `pandas` [read_sql_query](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.read_sql_query.html) method. The ORM of choice for pandas is [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/). By installing a couple more packages, you can query Redshift data and read that into a dataframe with just a few lines of of Python code."

    "## The Setup\n",
    "This post assumes you have a number of Python packages already installed, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `sqlalchemy` and `iPython` or `Jupyter Lab`. I've used the Python distribution [Anacoda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html), which can be downloaded [here](http://continuum.io/downloads). It comes packed with many of the [libraries](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs.html) you might need for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Dialects documentation](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/dialects/) for SQLAlchemy mentions that Redshift is supported through another Python package, which itself depends on a PostgreSQL driver. So, the additional packages needed for connecting to Redshift are [redshift-sqlalchemy](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-redshift/) and [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/). If you already have Anaconda, you can install `psycopg2` quickly using conda. For getting `redshift-sqlalchemy` installed, here are some docs on using [conda & pip](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/faq.html#env-installation) together. That being said, the process of downloading the packages looked like this in my terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "cd Downloads/redshift-sqlalchemy-0.4.1\n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, I did this in my default environment. Everything seems to work, but the Anaconda docs are very useful if you have multiple Python environments on your machine."
